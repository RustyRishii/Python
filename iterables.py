# Iterables = An Object/collection that can return it's elements one at a time,
#             Allowing it to be iterated over a loop.

# fruits = ("Apple", "Guava", "Pineapple")
# nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# for i in reversed(nums):
#     print(i, end="\n")


# fruit_sets = {"Apples", "Orange", "Banana", "Kiwi"}

# for fruit in fruit_sets:
#     print(fruit)

# This prints the elements of fruit_sets randomly cause sets are not ordered.
# using reversed would also throw an error
